## Description
2D PVP-oriented multiplayer fighting game where two people play as monsters and fight to the death. This project utilizes tools built into [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) and [PixelArtMaker](http://pixelartmaker.com/) to create our assets and build the game physics.

We would like to thank Unity for building such a great tool open for people like us.
